# Restaurant-Management-System
Project about a Restaurant Management System. 

-mainwindow files are for the main window of the project, where the tables and seats are showed

-menu file is where the menu of the restaurant is stored. Each food has a name and its price

-tables files is where the tables and seats are defined for the program

-tableclick is the window that pops-up when a table or seat is clicked. It gives the option to add or subtract food, return to main         window, print the check, clear the table, and refresh button (the functionality of this button 
	is obsolete, now). This window also, shows the total price the table or seat owes, and the food it has ordered.
	
-addfood and subtract food files, are the windows that pop-up when the buttons in tableclick are clicked. They simply let subtract and add
  food to the table.
